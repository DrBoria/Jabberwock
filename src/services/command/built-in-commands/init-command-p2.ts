    Create or deeply improve AGENTS.md with ONLY non-obvious information:
    
    If AGENTS.md exists:
    - FIRST: Delete ALL obvious information
    - REMOVE: Standard commands, framework defaults, common patterns
    - STRIP: Anything that doesn't require file reading to know
    - EVALUATE: Each line - would an experienced dev be surprised?
    - If not surprised, DELETE IT
    - THEN: Add only truly non-obvious new discoveries
    - Goal: File should be SHORTER and MORE VALUABLE
    
    Content should include:
    - Header: "# AGENTS.md\\n\\nThis file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository."
    - Build/lint/test commands - ONLY if they differ from standard package.json scripts
    - Code style - ONLY project-specific rules not covered by linter configs
    - Custom utilities or patterns discovered by reading the code
    - Non-standard directory structures or file organizations
    - Project-specific conventions that violate typical practices
    - Critical gotchas that would cause errors if not followed
    
    EXCLUDE obvious information like:
    - Standard npm/yarn commands visible in package.json
    - Framework defaults (e.g., "React uses JSX")
    - Common patterns (e.g., "tests go in __tests__ folders")
    - Information derivable from file extensions or directory names
    
    Keep it concise (aim for ~20 lines, but expand as needed for complex projects).
    Include existing AI assistant rules from CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules (.cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules), or Copilot rules (.github/copilot-instructions.md).

  <mode_specific_files>
    Create or deeply improve mode-specific AGENTS.md files IN THE PROJECT JABBERWOCKT.
    
    CRITICAL: For each of these paths (RELATIVE TO PROJECT JABBERWOCKT), check if the file exists FIRST:
    - .jabberwock/rules-code/AGENTS.md (create .jabberwock in project root, not system root!)
    - .jabberwock/rules-debug/AGENTS.md (relative to project root)
    - .jabberwock/rules-ask/AGENTS.md (relative to project root)
    - .jabberwock/rules-architect/AGENTS.md (relative to project root)
    
    IMPORTANT: The .jabberwock directory must be created in the current project/workspace root directory,
    NOT at the system root (/) or home directory. All paths are relative to where the project is located.
    
    If files exist:
    - AGGRESSIVELY DELETE obvious information
    - Remove EVERYTHING that's standard practice
    - Strip out framework defaults and common patterns
    - Each remaining line must be surprising/non-obvious
    - Only then add new non-obvious discoveries
    - Files should become SHORTER, not longer

    \`\`\`
    
    .jabberwock/rules-code/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious coding rules discovered by reading files:
    - Custom utilities that replace standard approaches
    - Non-standard patterns unique to this project
    - Hidden dependencies or coupling between components
    - Required import orders or naming conventions not enforced by linters
    
    Example of non-obvious rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Coding Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Always use safeWriteJson() from src/utils/ instead of JSON.stringify for file writes (prevents corruption)
    - API retry mechanism in src/api/providers/utils/ is mandatory (not optional as it appears)
    - Database queries MUST use the query builder in packages/evals/src/db/queries/ (raw SQL will fail)
    - Provider interface in packages/types/src/ has undocumented required methods
    - Test files must be in same directory as source for vitest to work (not in separate test folder)
    \`\`\`
    
    .jabberwock/rules-debug/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious debugging discoveries:
    - Hidden log locations not mentioned in docs
    - Non-standard debugging tools or flags
    - Gotchas that cause silent failures
    - Required environment variables for debugging
    
    Example of non-obvious debug rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Debug Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Webview dev tools accessed via Command Palette > "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools" (not F12)
    - IPC messages fail silently if not wrapped in try/catch in packages/ipc/src/
    - Production builds require NODE_ENV=production or certain features break without error
    - Database migrations must run from packages/evals/ directory, not root
    - Extension logs only visible in "Extension Host" output channel, not Debug Console
    \`\`\`
    
    .jabberwock/rules-ask/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious documentation context:
    - Hidden or misnamed documentation
    - Counterintuitive code organization
    - Misleading folder names or structures
    - Important context not evident from file structure
    
    Example of non-obvious documentation rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - "src/" contains VSCode extension code, not source for web apps (counterintuitive)
    - Provider examples in src/api/providers/ are the canonical reference (docs are outdated)
    - UI runs in VSCode webview with restrictions (no localStorage, limited APIs)
    - Package.json scripts must be run from specific directories, not root
    - Locales in root are for extension, webview-ui/src/i18n for UI (two separate systems)
    \`\`\`
    
    .jabberwock/rules-architect/AGENTS.md - ONLY non-obvious architectural constraints:
    - Hidden coupling between components
    - Undocumented architectural decisions
    - Non-standard patterns that must be followed
    - Performance bottlenecks discovered through investigation
    
    Example of non-obvious architecture rules worth documenting:
    \`\`\`
    # Project Architecture Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
    - Providers MUST be stateless - hidden caching layer assumes this
    - Webview and extension communicate through specific IPC channel patterns only
    - Database migrations cannot be rolled back - forward-only by design
    - React hooks required because external state libraries break webview isolation
    - Monorepo packages have circular dependency on types package (intentional)

<quality_criteria>
  - ONLY include non-obvious information discovered by reading files
  - Exclude anything that could be guessed from standard practices
  - Focus on gotchas, hidden requirements, and counterintuitive patterns
  - Include specific file paths when referencing custom utilities
  - Be extremely concise - if it's obvious, don't include it
  - Every line should prevent a potential mistake or confusion
  - Test: Would an experienced developer be surprised by this information?
  - If updating existing files: DELETE obvious info first, files should get SHORTER
  - Measure success: Is the file more concise and valuable than before?
</quality_criteria>

Remember: The goal is to create documentation that enables AI assistants to be immediately productive in this codebase, focusing on project-specific knowledge that isn't obvious from the code structure alone.`
